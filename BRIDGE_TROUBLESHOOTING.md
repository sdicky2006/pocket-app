# Bridge Connection Troubleshooting

## Issue: "Nothing happens after pasting the script"

If you paste the bridge script and see no connection, here's how to troubleshoot:

### ✅ Step 1: Check Console Messages

After pasting the script, you should see these messages in the console:

```
🚀 Pocket Option Bridge Starting...
🔍 Looking for existing WebSocket connections...
✅ Bridge script installed! Monitoring for WebSocket connections...
🏠 App connection test: connected
```

If you see these messages, the script is working correctly.

### ✅ Step 2: Activate the Connection

The bridge script only intercepts WebSocket connections when they're created. You need to:

1. **Go to the trading interface** on Pocket Option
2. **Or refresh the page** if you're already on the trading page
3. **Open a chart** or start a trading session
4. **Wait for trading data to load**

### ✅ Step 3: Look for Connection Messages

When the connection activates, you'll see:

```
📡 Found existing WebSocket: wss://...
✅ Hooked into existing connection!
🔗 Successfully connected to your trading app!
```

OR

```
📡 New WebSocket connection: wss://...
🔓 WebSocket opened: wss://...
🔗 Successfully connected to your trading app!
```

### 🔧 Common Issues & Solutions

#### Issue: No console messages at all
**Solution:**
- Check you're on pocketoption.com (not another site)
- Make sure you typed `allow pasting` first
- Try pasting the script again

#### Issue: Script installed but no WebSocket connections
**Solution:**
- Navigate to the **trading interface** (not just the homepage)
- **Refresh the trading page**
- **Click on charts or trading pairs** to activate connections
- Make sure you're logged into your Pocket Option account

#### Issue: "Could not reach your app" message
**Solution:**
- This is normal and doesn't prevent the bridge from working
- The WebSocket forwarding will still function correctly
- Your trading app will receive the data

#### Issue: WebSocket connections found but no data in app
**Solution:**
- Check the Network tab in Developer Tools
- Look for POST requests to `/api/bridge/ws-stream`
- Make sure Pocket Option is actively sending trading data

### 🎯 How to Verify It's Working

1. **In Console**: Look for "🔗 Successfully connected to your trading app!"
2. **In Your App**: Check if the bridge status changes to "connected"
3. **In Network Tab**: Look for ongoing POST requests to your app
4. **In App Data**: Watch for live price updates and trading signals

### 📍 Where to Find Trading Interface

On Pocket Option:
1. **Log in** to your account
2. **Click "Trade"** in the main menu
3. **Select a trading pair** (EUR/USD, etc.)
4. **Wait for the chart to load**
5. The WebSocket connection should activate automatically

### 🔄 Refresh Method

If the script is installed but not connecting:
1. **Keep the console open** (don't close Developer Tools)
2. **Refresh the page** (F5 or Ctrl+R)
3. **The script will remain active** and catch new connections
4. **Navigate to trading interface** after refresh

### 🆘 Last Resort: Manual Connection Test

If nothing works, try this test script to verify connectivity:

```javascript
// Test script - paste this after the main bridge script
fetch('/api/bridge/status')
  .then(r => r.json())
  .then(data => console.log('✅ App reachable:', data))
  .catch(e => console.log('❌ App not reachable:', e));
```

### 📊 Success Indicators

**Console Messages:**
- ✅ Bridge installed
- ✅ WebSocket found/connected
- ✅ App connection test passed

**In Your Trading App:**
- ✅ Bridge status shows "connected"
- ✅ Live data flowing
- ✅ Trading signals working

**In Browser Network Tab:**
- ✅ Regular POST requests to `/api/bridge/ws-stream`
- ✅ 200 status codes on requests
